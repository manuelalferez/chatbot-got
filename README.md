## Description

The goal is to build a small chatbot of Game of Thrones with [Botonic](https://github.com/hubtype/botonic).

These are the requirements of the bot:
* When the user talks for the first time, the bot should show a carousel with the different GoT Houses. 
* Each element of the carousel should have a button that, when clicked, should return the Words of that given House. 
* If a House has no Words, it should not appear in the carousel.
* If the user says anything, the bot will simply reply with a random quote.
Use the following public APIs: https://anapioficeandfire.com/ and https://api.quotable.io/random
* Extra: adapt the webchat styles with GoT (anyway you like, use your creativity!).
